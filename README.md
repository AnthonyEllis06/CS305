Q: Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
A:Artemis Financial is a Financial consulting company that wanted me to consult and fix their security vulnerabilities by implementing industry standard security standards.

Q: What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
A:I believe I did well at implementing a secure hash algorithm and represented well, why it was a good algorithm.

Q: Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
A:I think my most difficult time was was with learning how the run setups worked. I kept on getting lost in directories too. 

Q: How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
A: I increased the security with a certificate key and a hash algorithm. In the future it would be better to build security around a more full fledged project.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
A:I used the dependency check to check vulnerabilities after the refactor.

Q: What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
A:The keytool will be super helpful in the future. I also like that I now have a much better understanding of eclipse run configurations

Q: Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
A: Primarily that I know how to use the keytool. I think using certificates in the future will be unequivically usefull.
